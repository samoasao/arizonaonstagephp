(portrayed by Betty Craig), a glamorous, commanding, larger-than-life, caustic,
and surprisingly drop-dead funny pedagogue of a voice instructor. Alternately dismayed and impressed by the students who parade before her (Kriste' Belt, Erich P. Covey, Katherine Mendelson), she retreats into recollections about the glories of her own life and career. Included in her musings are her younger years as an ugly duckling, her fierce hatred of her rivals, the unforgiving press that savaged her early performances, her triumphs at La Scala and her affair with Aristotle Onassis.
It all culminates into a tour de force about sacrifices made in the name of
art.<br><br>
