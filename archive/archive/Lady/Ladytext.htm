In this performance, about four months before her death, she presents music plus biographical stories, remarks and reminiscences. Between the more than a dozen songs, she regales the audience with a commentary that is sometimes profane and ribald, sometimes poignant, sometimes humorous, and always cooking with the hits of one of America's most famous jazz singers.<br><br>

Featuring acclaimed Tucson-based songstress Anna Anderson and pianist Collin Shook, this spare, riveting play recreates the ambiance and allure of a shady late-50s club and a legendary but tragic performer at the close of her astonishing career. Songs include "Don't Explain," "God Bless the Child," "Strange Fruit" and "Gimme a Pigsfoot and a Bottle of Beer," among others, some well known, some obscure. The Cabaret at The Temple of Music and Art will be transformed into this club, with some seating table style, and wine and beer available.<br><br>

“By the end of her evening of song at Emerson's, one is filled with an unexpected joy.” – <i>New York Times Review</i>
