I'm Jody (aka the puppy)! Currently, I study Musical Theatre Management at the University of Arizona and bring home the Beggin' Strips by acting in "Murder at Magic Manor," a local murder mystery dinner theatre. I have performed such roles as Joseph in "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" and Nicely-Nicely in "Guys and Dolls." Although I am honored and thrilled to be performing in this magical production of BARK!, I am trying not to mess the rug while learning these complex harmonies.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="Images/Kit_bark.jpg" alt="Ben" hspace="10" align="left"><br><center>Kit Runge ~ Ben<br><br><p align="left">Kit Runge has played many roles over the years, both on and off the stage (you figure out which is which), including soldier, architect, husband, count, millionaire, hunter, engineer, private detective, author, gambler, father, lord, and expert witness.

Kit would like to thank his incredible wife Debbie and his three charming daughters Savannah, Piper, and Indigo for their continued patience (thanks sweetheart!), love, and support, and he dedicates this show to Cookie, their pet Sheltie.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="Images/Steph_1.jpg" alt="Chanel" hspace="10" align="left"><br><center>Stephanie Sikes ~ Chanel<br><br><p align="left">Stephanie Sikes, who is portraying Chanel, is a classically trained lyric soprano who also enjoys jazz and blues.
