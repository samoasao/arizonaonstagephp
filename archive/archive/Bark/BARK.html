  <p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans"'>“Bark!” explores 
  the lives of six dogs, in ‘doggie day care” and in the pound, some of whom
  are in need of new homes and a better life. Through song and story, the
  audience is exposed to the tenderness, aggression and frustration of these
  beings as they share personal stories of past and present, owners and
  friends, and their desire to be loved and part of a family. Local adoption and rescue agencies will participate in each performance, having photographs of adoptable dogs available in the lobby during each performance in hopes of finding them new and loving homes<br><br>Concepts don't get much simpler than the
  one behind this delightful musical. This performance will be its Arizona premiere. The
  show is sung entirely by dogs--played by humans, of course. The loosely
  connected songs, by composer David Troy Francis, are performed entirely from a dog's point of view, which
  might sound unbearably cutesy. However, it is surprisingly funny and
  poignant, tender and sassy, lyrical and quite upbeat.<br><br>The score is a happy melange of blues, salsa, country and straight torch songs. There are even echoes of
  &quot;A Chorus Line,&quot; “Carmina Burana” and barbershop quartet, not to mention rock ‘n
  roll, jazz and old standards.<br><br>The lyrics by Gavin Geoffrey Dillard and
  Robert Schrock (with additional lyrics by Mark Winkler, Jonathan Heath and
  Danny Lukic) are richly varied. A flight of fancy
  about space exploration, &quot;Terrier From Mars&quot; might seem initially fluffy
  — until we realize that the dog, chained in a barren backyard, is using space
  fantasies to distract himself from his confinement. In &quot;A Grassy
  Field,&quot; an old dog says farewell to its master before being put down — a
  lovely elegy with a moving kick. <br><br>A tribute to loyalty, unconditional love
  and all other doglike attributes, &quot;Bark!&quot; resonates — whether
  you're a dog lover or not. Family-friendly and energetic, these dogs will add
  a dash of excitement to your summer entertainment options. “Two Paws Up,”
  said the head of the Humane Society.<br><p><center>Check out the official web site at <a href="http://www.barkthemusical.com" target="Bark">BARK! The Musical</a><br><br></a></span>Reviews from previous productions <a href="REVIEWS_BARK.htm" target "Reviews">Reviews</a><br>
