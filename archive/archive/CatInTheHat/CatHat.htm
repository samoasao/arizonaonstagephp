<span style="font-family:Trebuchet;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;color:#1E90FF"><p style="text-align:left">From the moment his tall, red-and-white-striped hat appears around the door, Sally and her brother know that THE CAT IN THE HAT is the funniest, most mischievous cat they have ever met.

With the trickiest of tricks and craziest of ideas, he is certainly fun to play with. And he turns a rainy afternoon into an amazing adventure. But what will mum find when she gets home...? 

A lively, engaging "play with sound effects" for performance by adults for young children. Not a word has been touched or added to Dr. Seuss's classic, ensuring anyone who's read the story will be transported into the world they've always imagined.

Sally and the Boy are stuck inside, as the sun refuses to shine and day turns to wet and cold. Sally and Boy are not happy with being stuck in the house but fear they must resign to a life of sitting, sitting, and more sitting!

As the children fall asleep of boredom, we meet the Fish. Fish is swimming and splashing about in his bowl, dreaming of fanciful adventures with whales. Then, a whistle is sounded and something goes “bump.” The children and Fish are startled! What could it be?

They come to find that it is the Cat in the Hat. He has arrived to bring fun back into their life. The Cat proclaims that he knows “some new tricks.”<br><br><img src="Cat_in_the_Hat28.jpg" border="0" width="550" height="400" align="center"><br><span style="font-family:Trebuchet;font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;color:#1E90FF"><p style="text-align:left">Tickets for the Sunday, May 25 show at 12:30 are available at the door -- cash or check only please<br>
